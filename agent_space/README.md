# 🧠 Hoya Box: Agent Space

Welcome to the **Agent Space**, the modular brain of the Hoya Box ecosystem. This directory contains the autonomous agents, specialized skills, and operational rules that power your multi-agent development environment.

## 🚀 Overview

The Agent Space is designed to be grafted onto any project (the "Host Organism"). It provides a high-fidelity interface for strategic planning, autonomous execution, and real-time telemetry.

## 📋 System Dependencies

To utilize the full capabilities of the agents and skills housed within this space, the following system-level dependencies must be installed on your host machine:

### 1. Core Runtime
- **Google Gemini CLI**: The primary interface for interacting with these agents.
- **Python 3.10+**: Required for various utility scripts and data processing skills.

### 2. Media Production (`media-production-specialist`)
- **FFmpeg**: Required for programmatic video editing, splicing, and rendering.
  - *Installation*: `choco install ffmpeg` (Windows) or `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS).
- **ImageMagick**: (Optional) Recommended for advanced image manipulation in thumbnail design.

### 3. Office Automation (`office-automation-specialist`)
- **Python Libraries**: 
  - `python-docx` (Word manipulation)
  - `openpyxl` (Excel manipulation)
  - `python-pptx` (PowerPoint manipulation)
  - `gspread` (Google Sheets API)

### 4. Financial & Marketing Stack
- **Node.js**: (Optional) Some specialized plugins may require a Node runtime.
- **Git**: Required for the `cli-devops` agent to manage workspace state.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- `/agents`: Specialized AI personas (Orchestrator, Media Specialist, etc.).
- `/skills`: Atomic capabilities (Video Editing, API Connectors, Strategic Planning).
- `/rules`: The "Constitution" and operational guardrails.
- `/config`: Template files for API credentials (social, office, etc.).

## 🔑 Configuration & Secrets

This project uses a `.env` file in the root directory to manage API keys and secrets. 

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the project root.
2.  **Add your keys**: We recommend centralizing all LLM credentials here for ease of use.
    ```env
    # Google Gemini (Primary Interface)
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

    # Anthropic Claude (Peer Review / Scientific Rigor)
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
    ```

*Note: The `.env` file is already added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental leaks.*

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1.  **Initialize**: Ensure your project root follows the structure defined in `rules/project_standards.md`.
2.  **Configure**: Set up your `.env` file as described above. Also, copy templates in `/config` to their `.json` counterparts for specialized service credentials (Google Workspace, etc.).
3.  **Deploy**: Use the `agent-orchestrator` to begin a mission.

## 🛰️ Project: The Orbital Lead (Newsletter)

The **Orbital Lead** is an automated aerospace newsletter pipeline.

### Commands:
- `/orbital-lead "scout"`: (Thursday) Scrapes ArXiv and space news for high-signal GNC/Frontier tech.
- `/orbital-lead "write"`: (Friday) Generates technical newsletter drafts using GNC knowledge-bases.
- `/orbital-lead "growth"`: (Saturday) Creates social media threads and LinkedIn posts.
- `/orbital-lead "full-cycle"`: Executes the entire end-to-end production pipeline.
