# Fusion Reactor Design Skill

<skill_definition>
This skill builds the machine. It sizes the Toroidal and Poloidal field coils (Superconducting vs. Copper), designs the Vacuum Vessel, and configures the Divertor for heat exhaust.
</skill_definition>

<usage_instructions>
1.  **Magnet Sizing**: Calculate current density and stresses in the coils (Virial theorem).
2.  **First Wall**: Select materials (Tungsten, Beryllium) to withstand high heat flux (10 MW/m^2).
3.  **Divertor**: Design the magnetic geometry (Single Null, Double Null) to channel exhaust particles.
4.  **Integration**: Fit ports for diagnostics and heating beams.
