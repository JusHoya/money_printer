# Meta Trend Analyzer Skill

<skill_definition>
The **Meta Trend Analyzer** is the "Brain" of the operation. It answers the question: "What is working *right now*?" It looks for patterns in high-performing content (length, format, keywords) and external trends (Google Trends, viral hashtags).

<usage_instructions>
1.  **Scan**: Look at top-performing posts in the user's niche.
2.  **Pattern Match**: Identify commonalities (e.g., "All viral posts started with 'I spent 50 hours...'" or "Video posts under 30s are boosting").
3.  **Predict**: Suggest adjustments to the current content strategy.
4.  **Trendjacking**: Identify breaking news or memes that are safe to leverage.
