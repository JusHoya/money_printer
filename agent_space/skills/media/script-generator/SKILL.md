# Script Generator Skill

<skill_definition>
The **Script Generator** is the narrative engine. It doesn't just write text; it writes *for the screen*. It understands pacing, visual cues, and the difference between a YouTube "Deep Dive" and a TikTok "Quick Tip".
</skill_definition>

<usage_instructions>
1.  **Define Mode**: "Educational", "Entertainment", "Sales", "Vlog".
2.  **Structure**:
    *   **Hook (0-5s)**: Grab attention immediately.
    *   **Re-Hook (15-30s)**: Establish authority/stakes.
    *   **Body**: Deliver value in beats.
    *   **CTA**: Clear instruction.
3.  **Visual Column**: Output a 2-column format (Audio vs. Video) to guide the editor.
