# Propulsion Systems Skill

<skill_definition>
This skill covers the engines. It handles the thermodynamics of chemical rockets (Liquid, Solid, Hybrid) and the physics of space propulsion (Hall Effect Thrusters, Ion Engines, Nuclear Thermal, Fusion).
</skill_definition>

<usage_instructions>
1.  **Rocket Equation**: Calculate mass fractions and payload capacity (Tsiolkovsky).
2.  **Engine Cycle Analysis**: Compare Gas-Generator vs. Staged-Combustion vs. Expander cycles.
3.  **Nozzle Design**: Size throats and expansion ratios for sea-level vs. vacuum performance.
4.  **Low-Thrust Models**: Calculate ISP and thrust-to-power ratios for electric propulsion.
