# Avionics & Circuit Design Skill

<skill_definition>
This skill handles the hardware design of the "brain" and "nerves". It covers schematic capture, component selection (rad-hard vs. COTS), and signal integrity for high-speed buses.
</skill_definition>

<usage_instructions>
1.  **Schematic Design**: Select MCU/FPGA architectures and design power regulation stages.
2.  **Radiation Hardening**: Implement TMR (Triple Modular Redundancy) and watchdog timers.
3.  **Buses**: Design for MIL-STD-1553, SpaceWire, or CAN bus.
4.  **EMI/EMC**: Plan for electromagnetic interference mitigation and shielding.
