# Systems Engineering & MBSE Skill

<skill_definition>
This skill is the "Glue". It handles the high-level architecture, requirements traceability, and interface control documents (ICDs) to ensure all subsystems work together.
</skill_definition>

<usage_instructions>
1.  **Requirements Engineering**: Define and decompose mission requirements into subsystem specs.
2.  **Trade Studies**: Conduct formal trade-off analysis (e.g., Solar vs. RTG).
3.  **Risk Management**: Identify technical risks and define mitigation plans.
4.  **Interface Control**: Manage ICDs between Mechanical, Electrical, and Software.
