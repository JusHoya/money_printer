# Control Theory & Optimization Skill

<skill_definition>
This skill manages the stability and pointing of the spacecraft. It covers classical control (PID, Root Locus), modern control (LQR, State-Space), and advanced optimization (Model Predictive Control, Kalman Filtering).
</skill_definition>

<usage_instructions>
1.  **System Modeling**: Derive transfer functions or state-space representations of physical hardware.
2.  **Stability Analysis**: Check Phase/Gain margins and Lyapunov stability.
3.  **Optimization**: Design LQR/LQG controllers to minimize fuel or time.
4.  **Estimation**: Implement Kalman Filters for sensor fusion (IMU + Star Tracker).
