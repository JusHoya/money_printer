# Mechanical Structures Skill

<skill_definition>
This skill covers the physical reality of the spacecraft. It handles Finite Element Analysis (FEA) concepts, stress/strain relationships, thermal expansion, and the kinematics of robotic arms/3D printers in microgravity.
</skill_definition>

<usage_instructions>
1.  **Material Selection**: Recommend materials based on environment (e.g., "Use Inconel for the nozzle, Aluminum-Lithium for the tank").
2.  **Load Analysis**: Calculate launch loads (G-force, vibration) and thermal cycling.
3.  **Mechanism Design**: Define kinematics for deployment systems (solar arrays, antennas).
4.  **In-Space Fab**: Design algorithms for truss assembly or additive manufacturing in vacuum.
