# Portfolio

Your portfolio represents a detailed overview of your financial assets and is composed of a combination of the cash funds you have on hand in your account, as well as the current market value of any open trading positions you are actively engaged in or resting orders you have placed. The value of your portfolio can fluctuate due to changes within the markets you are trading in.&#x20;

### Navigating Your Portfolio

In your portfolio, you have access to important details about your trading activities that can help you track your trades efficiently. This includes specifics such as the number of contracts you have purchased, which allows you to effectively track your trading volume and analyze your market exposure at any given time. Additionally, you can view the average price at which these contracts were purchased. This provides vital insight into your cost basis and aids in assessing your overall financial strategy and management of investment costs.

Your portfolio provides you with the current value of your position, giving you a real-time assessment of how your trades are performing compared to their initial purchase price.&#x20;

Finally, your portfolio includes the total payout you can expect in the event of a win. This helps traders evaluate the potential returns on your investments, allowing you to strategize and forecast future financial outcomes based on trading activities.&#x20;
